# Triton Kernel Misadventures: L2 Norm Edition

A comprehensive educational journey through the challenges and solutions of implementing GPU-accelerated Euclidean norm (`nrm2`) calculations using **Triton kernels**. This notebook demonstrates common pitfalls in parallel GPU programming and provides practical solutions for achieving numerical correctness.

## Misadventures
1. **Single-Kernel Global Sum**: Using `tl.sum()` incorrectly for global reductions
2. **Atomic Operations Pitfalls**: How autotuner can accumulate incorrect results
3. **Race Conditions**: Multiple blocks writing to the same memory location

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- CUDA-enabled GPU (or ROCm for AMD GPUs)
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA Toolkit or ROCm installation

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions that improve the learning experience! Here's how to help:

### Ways to Contribute
- **Bug fixes**: Corrections to existing code or documentation
- **New misadventures**: Additional examples of common Triton kernel pitfalls and failures
- **Documentation**: Improvements to explanations of GPU programming concepts
- **Performance improvements**: Optimizations to existing kernels

### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make your changes and test thoroughly
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### Guidelines
- **For new misadventures**: Focus on common Triton kernel mistakes that produce incorrect results or fail in non-obvious ways
- **Include the "why"**: Explain what makes each misadventure a realistic trap for developers
- **Show the failure**: Demonstrate incorrect output, performance issues, or compilation errors
- **Provide the fix**: Include the correct approach with clear explanations
- **Test thoroughly**: Ensure all kernels produce correct results against PyTorch/NumPy equivalents
- **Add clear comments**: Explain GPU-specific concepts and Triton language features
- **Include performance notes**: Mention optimization considerations where relevant
